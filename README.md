# A very simple way to start a new blog as a developer.

This a starter theme for blogging with next.js and mdx. 

It's not a theme, or a framework or nothing like that. It' just a small functional project. 

You can clone or download it, make your changes and publish it. That's it. 

## Getting Started

Install the packages:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
